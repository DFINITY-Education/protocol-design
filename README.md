# About
In this course, students will learn about the basics of protocols, understand how core protocols create the internet as we know it, and develop a high-level conception of the Internet Computer Protocol. Using this knowledge, students will implement their own version of DNS and a basic banking application on the Internet Computer. Module 1 serves as an intro to this unit, providing context for protocol design that will then be leveraged in Modules 2-4 to implement several applications on the Internet Computer.
